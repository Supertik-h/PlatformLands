# PlatformLands
*game created for juice*
 
Hey! This is my little indie platformer made for juice, where you explore ancient ruins, jump around dangerous biomes, and (hopefully) don’t die too much. The game is not finished yet, there are only two biomes for now, stay tuned for more!

If you find any bugs (probably I know about them but can't fix them) or have suggestions, let me know!
Here's the game link

✨ Have fun and good luck! ✨
